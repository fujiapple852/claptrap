The following steps will guide you through the process of installing and running Claptrap.

<Steps>
  1. Install Claptrap:

     Claptrap runs on Linux, BSD, macOS, and Windows. It can be installed from most common package managers, precompiled binaries, or source.

     ```bash
     cargo install claptrap --locked
     ```

     See the [installation guide](/0.2.0/start/installation) for details of how to install Claptrap on your system.

  2. Create a script:

     `hello.sh`:

     ```bash
     #!/usr/bin/env bash

     set -euo pipefail

     eval "$(claptrap --spec - -- "$@" <<'SPEC'
       name = "hello"
       [args]
       name = { short = 'n', long = "name", default-value = "world" }
     SPEC
     )"

     echo "hello, ${claptrap_name}!"
     ```

  3. Make the script executable:

     ```shell
     chmod +x hello.sh
     ```

  4. Run the script:

     ```shell
     $ ./hello.sh -n fuji
     hello, fuji!
     ```
